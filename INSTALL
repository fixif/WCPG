WCPG library provides functions for a reliable evaluation of the Worst-Case Peak Gain matrix of a LTI filter. 

In order to compile the software you will need the following packages
installed:

	- gcc
	- g++
	- gmp
	- mpfr
	- mpfi
	- f2c 
	- blas (install dev version in aperture)
	- clapack (install dev version in aperture)
	- libtool

In order to configure, use the shell script file autogen.sh by invoking it using the
following command:

sh autogen

Then, in order to compile, use the makefile by invoking it using the
following command:

./configure
make

The configure script coming with this distribution of WCPG supports
several --with-*** switches. These switches, as usual, enable the libraries
WCPG depends on to be installed in non-standard directories.
Please use

./configure --help

to get an overview over the different switches.

Known problem: have to ensure that /usr/local/include is in the $CFLAGS to find f2c.h

The WCPG library can be installed with command

make install

An example of a program, which uses libwcpg is build instantly with the library and can be invoked using
a test program which is located in TestProgram using following interface:

./testProgram filename.txt precision

where precision is indicated in format 1e-X.

For example,

cd exampleProgram & ./exampleProgram examples/eigen_example.txt  1e-45

After installation, library WCPG can be linked using -lwcpg.
